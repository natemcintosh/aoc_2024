# aoc_2024
Advent of Code 2024. An attempt to do this in go.

## Running a day
To test a certain day, run `just run-day <day>`, or `just rd <day>`. For example, to run day 1, run `just run-day 1`, or `just rd 1`.

## Testing a day
To run all tests, run `just` in the root of the project. To run a single day, run `just td <day>` where `<day>` is the day you want to run; e.g. `just td 1`, or `just td 17`.
